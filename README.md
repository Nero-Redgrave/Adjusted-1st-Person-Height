# Adjusted-1st-Person-Height

A small little mod that changes the 1st Person Ingame Height for all Characters. For consistencies sake Kruber/Kerillian/Saltzpyre/Sienna are all slightly higher with the anchor point being their eye level while standing straight. And in an effort to help Bardin not feel like he's gimped in terms of headshot rate/angle he's gotten a small increase to height of about ~15%.

[Respective to Kruber/Bardin/Kerillian/Saltzpyre/Sienna]

Old Values - were previously 1.65u/1.3u/1.5u/1.7u/1.55u.

New Values - are currently 1.775u/1.5u/1.685u/1.8u/1.6u.

This mod is entirely client side.
